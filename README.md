ðŸ¤– Business Chatbot AI

Business Chatbot AI is an interactive, user-friendly chatbot designed to help users seamlessly buy or sell a business. Built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this chatbot runs fully in the browser without any need for a backend or database.

The bot offers a simple conversational interface that guides users through a step-by-step process. If the user selects "Buy," the bot collects preferences such as the type of business, budget, and location. If the user selects "Sell," it asks for the selling timeframe, business type, expected price, and location. At the end of either flow, the bot offers an option to schedule a meeting via Calendly for a smoother follow-up process.

The design is clean, modern, and mobile-responsive. A floating assistant icon is present on the screen to assist users at any time, making the experience even more intuitive and engaging.

The bot features animations, button-driven interactions, and text-based input fields. All validations are handled on the client side using JavaScript, ensuring a smooth user experience. The chatbot is perfect for showcasing beginner to intermediate front-end development skills, especially in user interaction, dynamic DOM manipulation, and clean UI/UX design.
